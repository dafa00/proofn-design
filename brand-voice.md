## Three main characteristic Proofn's voice

### **Intelligible**

Basically users are less interested in information that is too long, and they don't have time to read all the information. Put your important word or phrase in the front of sentences. So that the user's eyes catch important words when they scan the message information displayed. Be concise, understand the needs of users in certain situations and give them enough information to help perform tasks successfully on the application. Give useful information directly and quickly to offer help.

### **Catchy**

Use natural voice so that users can be easily understood and remember. Describe something in a friendly manner that does not use a frontal or aggressive language that can make users afraid to explore the application. Use the persusasive sentences on certain pages to encourage users to try. Finally, Do not forget to use polite and pleasant language to make users comfortable using the application for a long time and not excessive use.

### **Professional**

Users need special space when communicating about important matters or relating to their business. Provide serious information format, so that the information provided does not seem to play around or confuse the users. Add formal language and do not seem to act like a teacher be know-it-all in some message information in the application. Be consistent, surprise and uncertainty make people uncomfortable using an application. Words in the application must be considered carefully, so that users feel like they are special and have a pride when communicating.
