# Illustration Type

#### Scene **\(**Interpretable\)

A scene illustration works on a larger space and allows the user to explain a feature or a scenario with a more detailed driven approach.

#### Spot \(Readable\)

A spot illustration is used to help showcase a small feature or explain an experience. Theyâ€™re lightweight, not too busy but are there to help enhance the flow by bringing the interface to life and delighting the user.

**Icon \(Interact-able\)**

We use icons across the site to give prominence and to enhance the usability of specific elements across the interface. They can be used from 12px up to 64px. We have more rules around how to use iconography in our UI styleguide.
