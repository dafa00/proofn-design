# Moodboard

Believe it or not, creating a moodboard is one of the most important parts of the design and product process. Surprisingly, this also seems to be an overlooked part of the process as well. I don’t mean overlooked altogether, more so overlooked in importance. Moodboards I come across tend to be a handful of images the designer thought “looked cool” but didn’t serve an actual purpose in the completed project.
